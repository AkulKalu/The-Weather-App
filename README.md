### The-Weather-App

This was the first thing i developed using React. Not very interesting but it was good practice. I used openweathermap api to pull data, 
and locationIq api for coordinates. Im aware its a bit hard to read data depending on the weather, cause i switch pictures in background.

## - Note -
Geo location might be a bit inaccurate cause its having problems reading the ip with the built in API from the hosting server, so i used some third party one, not a very good one it seems.
